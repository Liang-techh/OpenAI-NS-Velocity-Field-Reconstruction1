# Navier–Stokes Velocity-Field Reconstruction

**Independent reconstruction of structured Navier–Stokes velocity fields: source-tracked profile construction, functional moment repair, multiscale diagnostics and reproducible validation.**

The current research route is an exploratory **Lei–Ren Part I-oriented ST073 reconstruction**. The long-term deliverable is a nonzero, divergence-free, finite-energy, three-dimensional time-dependent field with quantitatively verified shrinking-core geometry and independently evaluated momentum residuals. This is an independent research repository, not an OpenAI project or a claim to have recovered an exact original field.

> **Reviewed snapshot: 2026-10-06 UTC.** Research through [9b0d142d](https://github.com/Liang-techh/OpenAI-NS-Velocity-Field-Reconstruction1/commit/9b0d142d884320d78ce9cdc17921fb69b273146c): same-source nonsingular core-axis stress/remainder, four full angular support traces and one native registry now cover33 regional APIs,32 adjacent/14 internal traces. The axis is a coordinate extension, not another region. **The unchanged leading remainder is nonflat at the physical origin:** `E_z=sqrt(nu)*k_axis*tau^((-3+delta)/2)` has positive coefficient lower bound about1.747835e-22 and negative time exponent, so it diverges as tau approaches zero. This identifies a term genuine coefficient/stress recovery must cancel or absorb; it does not rule out future corrected constructions. Native/source spatial admission does not certify automatic physical-coordinate location, global physical coverage, cone/lift, resolved u/v/w/p or corrected NS. Those gates remain open, along with actual n-dependent recursion, corrected temporal-flat remainder and measured dynamics. **Known unlocalized whole-space kinetic-energy divergence remains.** Receipt/source/gzip/hash review is not scientific replay or independent proof audit. See the [latest supervision checkpoint](docs/NS_SUPERVISION_2026-09-30.md).

```

Historical absolute-closure receipts remain scoped to their own compliant epsilon=.001delta source. The current complete graph installs the repaired source in all33 physical owners and consumes its separate Gamma similarity-stress certificate. Quantitative all-interface bounds and full physical tensor admission remain open. Cartesian maps now retain basis differentiation, but separate regional derivatives do **not** establish complete physical-field assembly, globally vanishing stress or an independent flat remainder. Full physical energy cannot be inferred from finite radial swirl tails: the axial endpoint weight is nonintegrable for the current unlocalized source. No new axial cutoff or reduced finite-energy goal is adopted. The small moment/fixture errors are **not** full NS residuals. See the [eight-goal assessment](docs/RESEARCH_STATUS.md) and latest checkpoint.

## Choose the correct layer

| Purpose | Entry point | Availability and limit |
|---|---|---|
| Continue ST073 construction | [Pinned research checkout and ordered driver](docs/CURRENT_CHECKPOINT.md#st073-research-checkout) | Research branch; not promoted into the main compatibility API |
| Inspect current milestones | [Research status](docs/RESEARCH_STATUS.md), [structured snapshot](docs/reconstruction_status.json) | Source-bound evidence and explicit open gates; no completion percentages |
| Inspect earlier numerical results | [ST061/ST063 results](docs/LEGACY_NUMERICAL_RESULTS.md), [asset catalog](docs/research_catalog.json) | Historical candidates and separately delivered bundles; original momentum gates fail |
| Use the checked-in MATLAB viewer | [Visualization hub](visualization/README.md) | ST054-Q2/M3, not an ST073 time-dependent reconstruction |
| Use the compatible Python API | `research_baseline.load_best()` | Still returns frozen ST006; its name is not a latest-candidate selector |

## Existing main-checkout quick starts

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python scripts/ns_candidate.py verify
python scripts/ns_candidate.py evaluate --point 0.1 0 0.1 --time 0.5
```

These are **ST006 compatibility commands**, not an ST073 scientific acceptance test.

```matlab
addpath('visualization/matlab');
ns_explorer;
```

This opens the existing **ST054** viewer. ST063 comparison data has separate bundle requirements; see [visualization and provenance](visualization/README.md).

## Scientific acceptance

The final numerical target remains **both full-vector momentum maximum and spatial volume L2 at or below `1e-3`**, under an explicitly registered physical problem, forcing model, units and validation protocol. Sampled maxima are not certified continuous suprema. The force must be prescribed or constrained independently, not freely defined to cancel the candidate residual.

The ST006/ST061/ST063 benchmark keeps its original viscosity, domain, support, nontriviality and forcing requirements. ST073 must explicitly connect its similarity-coordinate construction to a physical validation problem; its local identities do not inherit a benchmark pass.

**No acceptance promotion:** `pde_validated=false`, `paper_exact=false`, `blowup_proved=false`; the reviewed ST073 driver also retains `full_NS_background_completed=false` and `temporal_recursion=false`.

## Preservation and history

Code, coefficients, raw reports, configurations, workflows, research branches and scientific thresholds are preserved. Organization is through entry points and evidence routing, not bulk renaming or merging unfinished research code. The September 22 pause record is historical and does not establish whether a task is running now.

See [experiments](experiments/README.md), [branches](docs/BRANCH_AND_PR_GUIDE.md), and the [organization record](docs/ORGANIZATION.md). The [repository without the trailing 1](https://github.com/Liang-techh/OpenAI-NS-Velocity-Field-Reconstruction) is a separate publication project and is unchanged.
